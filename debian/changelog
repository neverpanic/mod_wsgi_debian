mod-wsgi (2.0~c1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control: reverting the change from -1
  * debian/patches:
    - Adding ap_thread_stacksize.dpatch to allow us to build the module using
      apache-threaded-dev. In the rare case that somebody would like to
      configure the stack size of WSGIDaemonProcess, both ThreadStackSize and
      stack-size option need to be set due to this change.
